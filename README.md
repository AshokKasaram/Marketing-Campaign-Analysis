# Marketing Campaign Analysis using Uplift Modeling & A/B Testing

**Objective:**  
Evaluate the effectiveness of a marketing campaign using A/B testing and uplift modeling techniques. Quantify the impact of ads on user conversion and identify persuadable customers for optimized targeting.

---

## Key Questions
- Did the marketing campaign drive a significant uplift in conversions?
- Can we quantify the incremental revenue generated by the ads?
- Which users are most likely to be influenced by the marketing campaign?

---

## Dataset Overview
- **Rows**: 588,101 user records  
- **Columns**:  
  - `user_id`: Unique user identifier  
  - `test_group`: Ad exposure group ("ad" or "psa")  
  - `converted`: Whether the user made a purchase  
  - `total_ads`: Number of ads seen  
  - `most_ads_day`: Day with highest ad exposure  
  - `most_ads_hour`: Hour with highest ad exposure  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- **Modeling:** scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)  
- **Visualization:** seaborn, matplotlib  
- **Statistical Testing:** `statsmodels` (Z-test, Power Analysis)  
- **Techniques:** A/B Testing, Uplift Modeling, Confidence Intervals, Feature Engineering

## Workflow Summary

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed redundant index columns
- Standardized column names
- Verified and handled missing values

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed conversion rate across `ad` and `psa` groups  
- Visualized user distribution by ad exposure (day/hour)

### 3. Statistical Significance Testing
- Applied **Two-Proportion Z-Test**  
- Found statistically significant lift in conversions (p < 0.001)  
- Estimated **43% relative lift** in conversion rate

### 4. Incremental Revenue Estimation
- Assumed revenue per conversion: **$50**  
- Estimated **$217K+ incremental revenue** from ad exposure

### 5. Power Analysis
- Achieved **100% statistical power** â€” large enough sample size

### 6. Logistic Regression Modeling
- Trained model to estimate conversion probability  
- Analyzed feature importance (e.g., total ads, day/hour effects)

### 7. Uplift Modeling
- Trained separate models for treatment and control groups  
- Computed **uplift scores** for all users  
- Segmented users into:
  - **Persuadable**
  - **Potential Persuadable**
  - **Sure Thing**
  - **Do Not Disturb**

### 8. Business Targeting Strategy
- Identified top persuadable users for retargeting  
- Recommended **data-driven segmentation** for budget optimization

## Key Results
- Ads drove statistically significant improvement in conversions  
- Campaign yielded **$217K** in estimated incremental revenue  
- Uplift modeling enabled **personalized campaign targeting**

---

## Future Improvements
- Apply **causal forests** or **X-learner** for more granular uplift
- Integrate with live marketing data and deploy targeting engine
- Use LTV models to optimize spend based on long-term value
